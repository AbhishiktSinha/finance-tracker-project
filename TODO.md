## What I'm working on: 
Balance Insights - *need separate logic*.  

~~Will try to tweak `reduceConvert` to accomodate both types of transactions~~ âœ…

## Styling TODOs
- Function to check number of digits in amount, and style accordingly

## Features to Implement
- Elevatae `dashboardTransactions` state slice to `primaryTransactions`, available to the entire application instead of being localized to `dashboard`.

- `primaryTransactions` state should the transactions for a time-period of `1 year` instead of the current year. 

- Dashboard Page Timeframe Toggle

- Dashboard components wrapped in Flex rows

- Balance Insights

- Budgets

- Saving Goals

- Transfer amounts from Usable Balance to Savings Balance

- Draw amounts from savings for expenditure transactions

- Currency Exchange

## Pages & Routes Still to Create
- `/settings`
- `/statistics/income`
- `/statistics/expenditure`
- `/statistics`
- `/history` or `/transactions`

## Optional Cards for `Dashobard` Page
- budget card
- savings card
- balance-by-currencies card
- currency-convertor card



## Currency Conversion QuickAction 
Add a QuickAction Button opens a currency conversion modal.  
Leverage the day's conversion rates stored in `localStorage`.  

Button stays loading as long as the exchange-rate API calling process is ongoing.  


## Week Starts On [customisation setting]
Allow the user to select the starting day of the week: `Sunday` or `Monday`.  
By default `Monday` following the ISO Week definition


## Custom Tag Checks
Check before adding a custom tag, if a tag with a similar name doesn't already exist.  
Computation uncessarily heavy for client side, need a backend.  

## Extra Fields in Transactions & File uploads
Learn file uplaods using Firebase Storage  
Add code to accomodate extra fields in a transaction document:  
<pre>
{ 
    reciept: __url__, 
    paymentMode: // only for expenditure transactions
    description
}
</pre>
